# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Announces Industry Accelerators

Dynamics 365 announced the Microsoft Power Platform, a connected app platform that unifies access to your data to enable ISVs, SIs, Partners and Customers to build intelligent, data driven, task focused business and analytic applications. Microsoft is focused on enabling a data culture where the Microsoft Power Platform acts as the glue across Dynamics 365 (CE, F&O, Talent), Office 365 (SharePoint, Teams), Power BI, Power Apps, Microsoft Flow, Azure and other 3rd party on-premise and cloud based solutions.

With the Power Platform providing a unified approach to building data driven solutions, the team is taking it one step further by introducing Industry Solution Accelerators. Accelerators are industry focused foundational components that enable ISVs and other solution providers, a way to build solutions that are based on industry standards supported and driven by Microsoft. Along with our Health Accelerator that was released during Inspire 2018, which you can read about here, we are focused on delivering accelerators for the following industries (but not limited too):

## Overview of the Industry Higher Education Accelerator
The Microsoft Higher Education Accelerator is the second Industry Accelerator from Microsoft following the release of the Healthcare Accelerator earlier this summer. Industry Accelerators are foundation components within the Microsoft Power platform and Dynamics 365 that enable ISVs and other solution providers to quickly build industry vertical solutions.

The Higher Education data model, solutions, data samples, Power BI examples, SDK extensions, and more are provided as part of the open source creative license and available on GitHub. The development of the Higher Education model was done in collaboration with leading industry expert solution providers focused on Higher Education and Microsoft is committed to working with the higher education community to provide regular updates to Accelerator.

The Higher Education Accelerator, Microsoft Power platform and Dynamics 365 provide the building blocks for ISVs to build solutions to address the unique needs in Higher Education. In this blog post, I’m delighted to highlight some of the early adopters of the Higher Education Accelerator.
